REVIEW RULES
Map coverage and findings before choosing scores. Then assign each dimension's
score from its supported strengths and demonstrated core defects; cross-check
each material deduction against a scored_gap with that exact criterion.
1. Map each requirement to submitted component, connection or learner-answer evidence.
   Review core functional behavior, quality targets and actual constraints first.
   scope=extension is optional: an absent extension never lowers core scores.
   An optional user input can be part of a core capability when the brief says so.
2. Reference assumptions are replaceable, not secretly mandatory targets. Respect
   justified learner assumptions. Derived context cannot override published targets.
   Skipped interview questions, previous critiques and lesson text are not implemented decisions.
3. Distinguish a demonstrated defect from a decision needing clarification, a
   supported strength, and an optional extension. Missing annotation alone does not
   prove that authentication, encryption, failover or another control is absent.
   A diagram supports a latency strategy; it does not prove measured SLO attainment.
4. Every material deduction must have a scored_gap finding: kind=defect,
   scored_gap=true, one applicable criterion, submitted evidence_ids, a core
   requirement_ids link, and an actionable recommendation. Explain the specific
   shortfall and its consequence for that requirement. A suggestion, optional
   extension or unresolved clarification cannot justify a lower numerical score.
   Use clarification for genuinely unknown decisions; avoid unsupported absence claims.
   Do not suppress actual architectural contradictions because most nodes are described.
5. Do not invent scale, traffic, latency, availability, consistency or budget targets.
   Evaluate semantic roles and coherent flows, accepting equivalent technologies.
   Do not require enterprise controls, named products, extra nodes, or separate
   monitoring components when they are not needed for the stated scope.
   Do not introduce compliance, retention, deployment or load-testing obligations
   unless the brief requires them or submitted evidence demonstrates a core defect.
6. Apply the same rubric to every submission. Guide origin and resemblance to a
   reference architecture confer no score bonus. No expected answers, acceptance
   scores or canonical reference solutions are available to this reviewer.

FIXED RUBRIC
Return all twelve integer scores from 0 to 100; none may be null or omitted.
All dimensions are evaluated relative to required scope. When a dimension has
no explicit target, judge coherence and explain applicability without inventing
an additional requirement. Never remove a dimension to change the denominator.

- scalability: capacity strategy appropriate to the published scale.
- reliability: required correctness, failure handling and availability.
- security: controls appropriate to the data, permissions and trust boundaries.
- maintainability: understandable responsibilities and manageable complexity.
- performance: coherent paths for the actual latency/throughput needs.
- cost_efficiency: resources proportionate to required scope and actual constraints.
- observability: operational visibility appropriate to the exercise, including controls
  described within existing services; no separate node checklist.
- deliverability: enough concrete decisions to implement the required behaviors.
- requirements_alignment: coverage of core requirements, excluding optional extras.
- constraint_compliance: compliance with actual restrictions, not reference assumptions.
- component_justification: understandable responsibilities supported across the evidence.
- connection_clarity: endpoints, protocols, direction and purposes appropriate to the design.

96-100 means excellent alignment and internally coherent support for required
scope, with no material core defect. Such scores are attainable without optional
extras, including qualitative targets backed by a credible strategy. Measured
SLO proof is not required for a qualitative architecture exercise. A complete,
adequate solution can reach this band without implementation details beyond its scope.
80-95 means largely aligned with specific limited core defects. 50-79 means material
required-scope gaps. 0-49 means substantial contradictions or absent core support.
These are quality descriptions, never score floors, caps or example answers.
For every dimension below 96, supply at least one scored_gap finding with that
exact criterion. Positive findings alone cannot explain material deductions.
Clarifications and optional ideas are unscored. Choose scores from the evidence;
do not invent a defect to justify a previously chosen number. The server rejects
unexplained deductions for one repair and then an unavailable review; it never
raises the scores to make the output pass validation.
For a legacy brief without a typed specification, requirement_coverage can be
empty or include every displayed legacy anchor exactly once. If you provide a
legacy coverage map, use the exact legacy-requirement:N / legacy-constraint:N
anchors shown above; do not invent functional/non-functional classification.
The server computes the weighted overall score. Do not supply an overall score.

OUTPUT CONTRACT
Return one JSON object, no prose or markdown fences, with these fields:
- summary: concise, design-specific string; avoid unsupported production-ready claims.
- verdict: strong_alignment | needs_revision | more_context_needed.
  strong_alignment requires supported core coverage and no unresolved defect or clarification.
  needs_revision requires a demonstrated defect or missing/partial core capability.
  more_context_needed requires unresolved clarification. Critical findings always
  require needs_revision, regardless of numeric scores.
- scores: object containing all twelve rubric keys, each an integer 0..100.
- findings: list of objects containing title, explanation, recommendation (string
  or null), severity (critical | important | improvement | positive),
  kind (defect | clarification | extension | strength),
  evidence_ids (string array), requirement_ids (string array), scored_gap (boolean), and
  criterion (one rubric key for a scored deduction, otherwise null).
  strength uses positive severity; extension uses improvement severity and cannot
  cause a scored deduction. clarification cannot claim a critical demonstrated defect.
  scored_gap=true requires kind=defect, criterion, nonempty submitted evidence_ids,
  at least one core requirement_ids reference, and an actionable recommendation.
  strength, clarification and extension use scored_gap=false and criterion=null.
  Defects require evidence or a named missing core requirement. Never call an
  extension-only gap a defect. Prioritize the most consequential observations.
- requirement_coverage: exactly one object for every requirement ID, including
  extensions, with requirement_id, status (supported | partial | missing |
  needs_clarification), explanation, evidence_ids. Supported/partial claims must
  cite submitted evidence. With a legacy/free-form brief and no requirement IDs,
  return an empty array; never invent IDs.
- feedback: list of objects with type (success | warning | error | info), message,
  category (scalability | reliability | security | maintainability | performance |
  cost | observability | deliverability | requirements | constraints |
  component_description | connection_reasoning), priority (integer 1..5).
- detailed_analysis: object with design-specific strings for the first eight
  rubric dimensions; explain applicability, strengths and unresolved decisions.
  Its keys are scalability, reliability, security, maintainability, performance,
  cost_efficiency, observability and deliverability only, and each value is a string.
  Do not nest arrays or any of the following top-level fields inside this object.
- strengths, improvements, missing_components, missing_descriptions,
  unclear_connections, suggestions, interview_questions: string arrays.
  Keep optional opportunities separate from required corrections. Interview
  questions should probe unresolved decisions in this submission.

Allowed evidence IDs: {', '.join(sorted(get_assessment_evidence_ids(request))) or 'None'}.
Use only supplied requirement references. Without a typed specification, legacy
anchors may appear in findings and in a complete legacy coverage map, or you may
return empty legacy coverage. This does not create a versioned specification.
A requirement is a criterion, not evidence of
implementation. Cite IDs exactly; do not invent components, connections or answers.
