{problem_context}
**COMPONENTS:**
{components_text}

**CONNECTIONS:**
{connections_text}

**USER EXPLANATION:**
{request.explanation or 'No explanation provided'}

**KEY POINTS:**
{chr(10).join(f'- {point}' for point in (request.keyPoints or [])) or 'No key points provided'}

**REQUIREMENTS:**

**CONSTRAINTS:**
{request.problem.constraints if request.problem and request.problem.constraints else request.constraints or 'No constraints specified'}

**ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:**
Rate each aspect from 0-100, considering the problem context and requirements:

1. **Scalability**: Can this handle growth in users, data, and traffic as required by the problem?
2. **Reliability**: Will this remain available during failures and meet the reliability requirements?
3. **Security**: Are proper security measures implemented for this type of system?
4. **Maintainability**: Is this manageable, well-documented, and appropriate for the problem complexity?
5. **Requirements Alignment**: How well does this solution address the specific problem requirements?
6. **Constraint Compliance**: Does this solution respect the given constraints (budget, time, technology, etc.)?

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
Respond with a valid JSON object in this exact structure:
