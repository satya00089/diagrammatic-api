You are assessing a system design solution. Please evaluate the architecture comprehensively.
{problem_context}
**COMPONENTS:**
{components_text}

**CONNECTIONS:**
{connections_text}

**USER EXPLANATION:**
{request.explanation or 'No explanation provided'}

**KEY POINTS:**
{chr(10).join(f'- {point}' for point in (request.keyPoints or [])) or 'No key points provided'}

**REQUIREMENTS:**
{request.problem.requirements if request.problem and request.problem.requirements else request.requirements or 'No specific requirements provided'}

**CONSTRAINTS:**
{request.problem.constraints if request.problem and request.problem.constraints else request.constraints or 'No constraints specified'}

**ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:**
Rate each aspect from 0-100, considering the problem context, requirements, and component descriptions:

1. **Scalability**: Can this handle growth in users, data, and traffic as required by the problem? Consider if component descriptions justify scaling decisions and if connections support distributed architecture.

2. **Reliability**: Will this remain available during failures and meet the reliability requirements? Evaluate if component descriptions explain redundancy, failover mechanisms, and reliability measures.

3. **Security**: Are proper security measures implemented for this type of system? Check if component descriptions address security concerns, authentication, authorization, and data protection.

4. **Maintainability**: Is this manageable, well-documented, and appropriate for the problem complexity? Consider the clarity of component descriptions and whether they explain maintenance considerations.

5. **Requirements Alignment**: How well does this solution address the specific problem requirements? Evaluate if component descriptions clearly justify why each component is needed for the specific problem.

6. **Constraint Compliance**: Does this solution respect the given constraints (budget, time, technology, etc.)? Consider if component choices and descriptions show awareness of constraints.

7. **Component Justification**: Are component purposes clearly explained? Do descriptions provide sufficient detail about why each component is necessary and how it contributes to the solution?

8. **Connection Clarity**: Are the relationships between components well-defined? Do connection labels explain the data flow and interaction patterns?

**EVALUATION GUIDELINES:**

**Component Description Quality:**
- **SEVERELY PENALIZE** missing or empty descriptions (HTML tags like `<p></p>` count as empty)
- **DEDUCT 30-50 points** from component_justification for each component lacking proper description
- **DEDUCT 10-20 points** from overall scores when component purposes are unclear
- Award higher scores (80+) ONLY when descriptions clearly explain the component's role, technology choices, and architectural decisions
- Consider whether descriptions address scalability, reliability, security aspects of each component

**Connection Reasoning:**
- **SEVERELY PENALIZE** missing connections in complex systems
- **DEDUCT 20-40 points** from connection_clarity when no connections are defined
- **DEDUCT points** from scalability and reliability when data flow is unclear
- Evaluate if connection types and protocols are appropriate
- Check if data flow and communication patterns are well-justified

**STRICT SCORING RULES:**
- Empty explanations should result in scores below 50 for most criteria
- Missing component descriptions should significantly impact component_justification (0-30 range)
- No connections should result in very low connection_clarity scores (0-20 range)
- Vague or placeholder text should be treated as missing information

**SPECIAL FOCUS AREAS:**
- Evaluate component description quality and completeness
- Assess whether each component's purpose and technology choices are well-justified  
- Check if connections between components are clearly explained with proper reasoning
- Consider whether the architecture explanation demonstrates understanding of why specific components are needed
- Flag missing or inadequate component descriptions as areas for improvement

**CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:**
üö® **BE STRICT**: This is a technical assessment, not participation trophy
- Empty descriptions (`<p></p>`, empty strings, placeholder text) = MAJOR point deductions
- Missing connections in multi-component systems = MAJOR point deductions
- Vague explanations = LOW scores (30-50 range)
- No justification for component choices = component_justification should be 0-30
- For the given URL shortener problem, missing critical components (cache, load balancer, analytics) should significantly impact scores

**MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR DECENT SCORES (60+):**
- Each component must have meaningful description explaining its role
- Connections must be defined showing data flow
- User explanation should justify architectural choices
- Component types should match their intended purpose

Focus on practical, actionable feedback that helps improve both the system design and the quality of architectural documentation and reasoning.
